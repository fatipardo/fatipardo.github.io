I a computational structural biologist. The main goal of my research is to provide an explanation of how biomolecules work by analyzing their structure. Thanks to X-ray crystallography, NMR or Cryo-EM, it is possible to determine the position of the atoms that form biomolecules. Using simple physics the interaction between atoms is calculated, thus generating "movies" of the biomolecules in action!

I usually face the challenge of having noisy data, as well as having to identify relevant interactions among the hundreds of thousands of atoms that form the molecules. I use data science methods to help identify these key features and interactions.

If you want to learn about my research interests check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/1ADQfMj-MEk">video</a> on youtube. 

I made this video as part of a workshop at Stanford on Science Communication. I am passionate about teaching and sharing science to the general public.
