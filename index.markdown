<h1> Welcome to my site! </h1>

I am a computational structural biologist. I am currently a Postdoc at Stanford University in Michael Levitt's lab. 
Here you can find information about my interests and research. 
This website is under construction and it is a playground to explore my interests and improve my skillset.
