   <h2><strong>About me</strong></h2>

   <p>I a computational structural biologist. The main goal of my research is to provide an explanation of how biomolecules work by analyzing their structure. Thanks to X-ray crystallography, NMR or Cryo-EM, it is possible to determine the position of the atoms that form biomolecules. Using simple physics the interaction between atoms is calculated, thus generating "movies" of the biomolecules in action! </p>

   <p>I usually face the  challenge of having noisy data, as well as having to identify relevant interactions among the hundreds of thousands of atoms that form the molecules. 
      I use data science methods to help identify these key features and interactions. </p>
      
  <p>I am building this site to get familiar with github and practice html/css. I am using this website as a playground to explore my interests and improve my skillset.</p>       
  
  <p>If you want to learn about my research interests check out this <a href=" https://youtu.be/1ADQfMj-MEk" target="_blank"> video </a> on youtube. </p> 
  
  <p>I made this video as part of a workshop at Stanford on Science Communication. I am passionate about teaching and sharing science to the general public. </p>

   <h2>Education</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Bsc in Biomedical Science. Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.</li>
      <li>PhD in Chemistry. Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</li>
      <li>Postdoctoral Researcher at Structural Biology Department. Stanford University</li>
      </ul>

   <h2>RNA Polymerase</h2>
   </p>The following is a MD simulation of the RNA polymerase (2E2H). Each subunit is shown in a different color and surface representation. </br>
   The video was made with VMD.</p>
