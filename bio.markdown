I was born and raised in Mexico City. I completed my undergraduate education at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. 
I got a BSc in Basic Biomedical Research. This program was very special because it allowed me to be part of a research lab since the very first semester of freshman year. 
As a result, I was able to work on protein purification and characterization, modeling of cell differentiation with boolean networks, circadian rythms, and protein evolution.
I decided to move to Hong Kong to pursue a PhD in Chemistry, because I wanted to understand the central dogma of molecular biology at the molecular level. As part of my thesis, I performed MD simulations of the RNA polymerase and analyzed them with Markov State Models. I am currently working on the ribosome, in particular how it translocates during elongation and how the nascent peptide interacts with the exit tunnel.
